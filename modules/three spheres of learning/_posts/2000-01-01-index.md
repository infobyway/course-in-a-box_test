title: Three Spheres of Learning
---

Teens’ learning occurs primarily in three different contexts, or spheres: their relationships, their unique personal interests, and their academic, work, or community settings.<sup>1</sup> When the spheres are connected, teens’ quality of learning and engagement with learning increases. 

- **Relationships**: Teens learning with and from other teens as well as adults
- **Interests**: Aligned with teens’ goals and motivations
- **Opportunity**: Directed towards academic, civic, or economic achievement

Learning that engages all of these spheres is no longer learning teens have to do; it’s learning teens want to do because it is aligned with their goals and benefits these important areas of their lives.
