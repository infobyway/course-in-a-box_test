The ConnectedLib Toolkit was created to equip public youth library staff with the knowledge and skills they need to create connected learning programs at their own libraries. The modules can be completed as standalone lessons in any order, but working through the entire suite of lessons in order may help you get the most out of them. As a whole, the toolkit is designed to walk you through the connected learning basics, help you learn how to work effectively with teens, how to strategize and plan to implement connected learning in your own library, and how to reach out and work with your community to create effective connected learning programs for your youth patrons.
