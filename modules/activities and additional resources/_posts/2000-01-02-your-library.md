title: Activity - Your Connected Learning Plan
---

Now that you’ve had an overview of connected learning, what does this mean for you and your library? In this section you will create a simple plan to implement or enhance connected learning in your library’s youth services. If you complete additional ConnectedLib modules, you may make modifications to this document as you learn more. 

<div class="objectives">
<p class="box-title">After completing this section, you will be able to...</p>
<ul>
<li>Show how connected learning is related to your library‘s mission</li>
<li>Create a practical plan to implement or improve connected learning in your library</li>
</ul></div>

Note: the term “youth services” and “youth services department” are used throughout this section. Your department may have a different name, or your library may have no youth services department at all, and you are simply “the one who works with kids.” Whatever the situation, feel free to adjust the wording and the structure of the worksheet to fit your particular circumstances.

Any vision planning for youth services must start with an overview of the entire library. You will need your manager’s and director’s buy-in to allow you to take the time and effort to implement connected learning programs, so start by thinking about your library’s mission and strategic goals. Hopefully, your library has a strategic planning document where the vision is described in detail; if not, try to articulate this yourself based on what your director and manager have said and done in the past. Even if you do have a document to reference, you may wish to have a conversation with one or both of them to fully understand their vision for youth services. 

<table class="worksheet">
<tr><th colspan="2" align="center">ABOUT [YOUR LIBRARY'S NAME]</th></tr>
<tr><td width="25%">Library's mission:</td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Library's strategic vision:</td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Youth Service's [or your department's] mission:</td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr>

Go back and look at the self-assessment you completed at the end of Section 2. Which elements are strongly represented in your programs? Which elements are not? List these in the Connected Learning “Strengths” and “Weaknesses” boxes below. 

<table class="worksheet">
	<tr><th colspan="2">YOUTH SERVICES</th></tr>
	<tr><td width="25%">Connected learning strengths:</td><td></td></tr>
	<tr><td>Connected learning weaknesses:</td><td></td></tr>
</table>



Now formulate some connected learning goals, whether for yourself and your own professional development, your department, or your library, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses from the last step. Start with a small goal you can achieve within a month, then work up to longer-term goals. Include concrete steps you can take towards your goals. 

<table class="worksheet" width="75%">
	<tr><th colspan="2">Connected Learning Goals</th></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="2">In the next month...</td></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan="3" width="25%">[goal]</td><td>Action Step 1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Action Step 2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Action Step 3</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="2">In the next three months...</td></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan="3" width="25%">[goal]</td><td>Action Step 1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Action Step 2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Action Step 3</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="2">In the next six months...</td></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan="3" width="25%">[goal]</td><td>Action Step 1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Action Step 2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Action Step 3</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan="2">In the next year...</td></tr>
	<tr><td rowspan="3" width="25%">[goal]</td><td>Action Step 1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Action Step 2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Action Step 3</td></tr>
</table>


By completing the first three parts of section 4, you have created a simple but actionable plan for better implementing connected learning in your library. Now reflect on this module as a whole. Review the KWL you completed [at the beginning of the module](index.html), then complete the L(earn) section. What did you learn in this module? Did you learn everything from your W column? If not, discuss this with the rest of the class. 

- **Know**: What did you already know about connected learning? 
- **Want**: What did you want to learn about connected learning? 
- **Learn**: What did you learn about connected learning in this module?
